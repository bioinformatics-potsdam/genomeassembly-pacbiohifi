# genomeassembly_standards
a complete workflow and the report generation for the genome assembly coming from the PacBioHifi reads for the genotypes and haplotypes and their quality assessment. This is the complete genome assembly standardization coming from the PacBioHifi reads and includes all the scripts and the analysis for the reproducibility and the visualziation and the summary analysis. I contibue to update this, so that when there is an update, simply fork this and an update is autoclone in your github profile. This will save me a lot of time and also the email exchange and tracking all those. This also includes the shipping of the code to the hpc clusters and everything. I will later think of adding the Github actions to make it directly send to the clusters. 

The project summary is present in the ```projectsummary.md```. It is a markdown document and easily editable. If you want then i can convert this into the Tex for the writeup.
